This is the WikiHouse extension for use with Google SketchUp. Using it,  
you can:

* Import designs from the WikiHouse library.

* Share your designs easily through the WikiHouse library.

* Generate cutting sheets for your house designs.

**Installation**
  
1.  Download or clone the repository, then run `make build` to generate the `wikihouse_extension.rbz` file.
2.  Open SketchUp and navigate to **Window** > **Preferences** (Microsoft Windows) or **SketchUp** > **Preferences** (Mac OS X).
3.  Click on Extensions, which will display all current extensions installed. 
4.  Click on the *Install Extension* button and locate the built `wikihouse_extension.rbz` file to install it.

The plugin will then appear in the list of other extensions, and all necessary files will be copied to your plugins directory. If you ever wish to disable it, simply untick it in the list and restart SketchUp. 

On previous versions of SketchUp (version 7 and bellow) to install, simply download the `wikihouse-extension` directory and copy all contents over into your SketchUp `plugins` directory.
